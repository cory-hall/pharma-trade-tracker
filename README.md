Project Overview

Goal: Detect potential conflicts of interest by analyzing the timing of U.S. politiciansâ€™ pharmaceutical stock trades in relation to FDA approvals and healthcare legislation.

Core Questions This Project Will Try to Answer
Do politicians trade pharmaceutical stocks shortly before or after FDA drug approvals?

Is there a pattern in trading activity tied to specific drugmakers (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer, Biogen)?

Are legislative events (hearings, bills, or votes) correlated with stock trade timing?

Are disclosure deadlines (from the STOCK Act) being followed?
